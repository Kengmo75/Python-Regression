This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating how to perform data grouping, aggregation, and simple linear regression using the pandas library for data manipulation and scikit-learn library for machine learning in Python.
Data analysis is a crucial aspect of any data science project. The ability to effectively group and aggregate data allows us to derive meaningful insights from datasets. Additionally, conducting simple linear regression helps in understanding the relationship between variables and making predictions based on the data.

In this repository, we provide Python scripts demonstrating how to use the pandas library for data manipulation, including grouping and aggregating data, and how to perform simple linear regression using the scikit-learn library.
To run the scripts in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python (>=3.6)
pandas
scikit-learn
You can install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Kengmo75/Python-Regression.git
Navigate to the repository directory:
cd Python-Regression
You can then run the Python scripts provided in the repository using your preferred Python interpreter.
The repository contains the following Python scripts:

grouping_and_aggregating_data.py: Demonstrates how to group and aggregate data using pandas.
simple_linear_regression.py: Demonstrates how to perform simple linear regression using scikit-learn.
Each script is extensively commented to explain the functionality and usage.
We provide examples demonstrating how to use the scripts in real-world scenarios. These examples include:

Grouping and aggregating data from a dataset to calculate summary statistics.
Performing simple linear regression on a dataset to predict future values and make imformed business decisions
Please refer to the examples directory for detailed instructions on running these examples.
